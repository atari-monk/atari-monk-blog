# Coding Reflection

## Coding Garden 

Think of coding as cultivating a garden.  
Approach project like a growing plant.  
Nurture projects, prune when needed, and let them develop naturally.  
Just like healthy plants, projects go through different stages: growing, blooming, producing results, and eventually fading.  
By adopting this mindset, you can categorize projects based on their stage of growth.  

## Project Categories  

Projects fall into three main groups:  

- **code** – Active projects you're currently working on.  
- **code_product** – Completed projects that provide value and are considered finished.  
- **code_archive** – Experimental or inactive projects that are stored for potential future use.  

Game goal is to transition most projects into **code_product** status.  

## Gamification  

Make coding feel like a game.  
Note tasks, times.  
Reward accomplishments with playtime.
