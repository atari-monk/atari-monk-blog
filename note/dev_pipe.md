# Dev Pipe

## I need automatic pipeline. which takes a prompt, then takes output from you, test it in Python, and gives some report maybe, and goes in a loop till some product is achieved or something like that.

What you're describing is an **AI-powered iterative development pipeline**—where a system generates, tests, and refines outputs in a loop until a goal is met. You’ll need a combination of:  

1. **LLM (Text Generation)** – For generating code or content.  
2. **Python Execution Environment** – To test and validate outputs.  
3. **Automated Feedback System** – To analyze results and decide whether to continue iterating.  
4. **Loop Controller** – To manage the cycle and stop when conditions are met.  

### **How to Build It**  

#### **1. Use an LLM to Generate Code or Solutions**  
- You can use OpenAI's API or a local LLM like Llama 3 via Ollama.  
- The LLM generates Python scripts based on your prompt.  

#### **2. Execute the Code and Capture Results**  
- Run the generated Python code in a sandboxed environment (like `exec()` in Python, or a safer alternative like Docker containers).  

#### **3. Analyze the Output**  
- Check if the output meets the expected conditions (e.g., correct results, no errors, performance thresholds).  
- If it fails, log the errors and adjust the next prompt dynamically.  

#### **4. Loop Until a Satisfactory Output is Achieved**  
- If the results are incorrect or suboptimal, modify the prompt using an automated feedback mechanism and regenerate.  
- Repeat the cycle until success criteria are met.

### **Tools You Might Need**  
- **LangChain** (for managing LLM workflows)  
- **Python (with exec or subprocess calls)**  
- **Docker or a Safe Execution Environment** (to prevent dangerous code execution)  
- **Automated Evaluators** (unit tests, error detection, or even ML-based validation)  

Would you like a basic script to start with?

## I already got some script based on Selenium and I am taking prompts and output from Chrome ChatGPT automatically. So that's the first step, right?

Yes, that’s a solid first step! You’ve automated the prompt-input and response-extraction process using **Selenium** and Chrome, which means you can now focus on the next steps:  

### **Next Steps to Make It Fully Automatic**  

1. **Process the AI Output**  
   - If the response is Python code, save it as a `.py` file and execute it automatically.  
   - If it’s something else (e.g., text instructions), decide how to interpret it in your pipeline.  

2. **Execute and Test the Output**  
   - Use Python’s `exec()` or `subprocess` to run the script.  
   - Capture errors and results for analysis.  

3. **Evaluate the Results**  
   - Use predefined test cases to check correctness.  
   - Log errors and failure points.  

4. **Loop with Adjustments**  
   - If the test fails, modify the prompt (e.g., append error logs and ask for fixes).  
   - Resubmit to ChatGPT and fetch a new response.  

5. **Exit When the Goal is Achieved**  
   - Define a stopping condition: either passing all tests or reaching a max number of iterations.

### **Example Pipeline Logic in Python**
```python
import time
import subprocess
import selenium  # Your existing Selenium setup

while True:
    # 1. Fetch response from ChatGPT via Selenium
    ai_response = get_chatgpt_response("Generate a Python script to X")  # Your function

    # 2. Save the response to a Python file
    with open("generated_script.py", "w") as f:
        f.write(ai_response)

    # 3. Run the script and capture output
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["python", "generated_script.py"], capture_output=True, text=True)
        output = result.stdout
        error = result.stderr
    except Exception as e:
        error = str(e)

    # 4. Check for errors and decide next step
    if "error" in error.lower() or "traceback" in error.lower():
        print("Error detected, modifying prompt...")
        prompt = f"Fix the following error in the script:\n{error}\n{ai_response}"
        continue  # Loop again with the modified prompt

    # 5. Stop condition (e.g., correct output detected)
    if "Success" in output:
        print("Task completed successfully!")
        break

    time.sleep(2)  # Optional delay before next iteration
```

### **What’s Next?**  
Now, you can:  
- **Expand Automation** – Instead of just fixing errors, you can fine-tune responses to improve efficiency.  
- **Use a Structured LLM API** – Instead of Selenium, use OpenAI’s API for more stability.  
- **Add Smarter Evaluations** – Use AI to judge the quality of output before looping.  

Does this align with what you’re building?
