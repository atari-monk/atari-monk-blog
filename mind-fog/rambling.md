# **Rambling**

- I miss human touch, but can't stand humans.

- Everything is a machine.

- Everything feels like a trap.
  
- Everything is kind of oscillation.

- Market, society, civilization, values. Man made jungle.

- Exploitation is to make masses serfs and give surplus to the top.

- Person is a software protocol generated for communication.
  
- Feelings, thoughts, experiences, mind byproduct.
  
- Mind can build logical structures endlessly, yet knowledge is always limited.
